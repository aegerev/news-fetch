# News Project Using React

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## User Story

This project was created so that people could read the news without being distracted.

## TECHNOLOGIES USED

    * React
    * fetch()
    * newsAPI.org (https://newsapi.org/)

## Deployment
Unfortunately, newsAPI.org does not allow me to publish the news onto Github Pages. In order for me to do that, I have to upgrade to a paid subscription. :(

Therefore, the most you can do is the following:
   1. Clone the repository
   2. Go to the "react-news" folder
   3. install the necessary dependencies using npm install
   4. Start up the server using npm start.

I apologize for the inconvenience.
